(so, just the parent.)\n  - the map's values should be the vec of file.\n- then we loop over that map, and collect metadata, as usual.\n- when it comes time to render, we check each file to see if it is an \"_index.md\" file\n  - if it is, we look at it's web prefix path (the ancestors), and then grab everything in the associated vector, and \n    pass it to the _index.md file's context so it's available in the layout.","files":null}]}
